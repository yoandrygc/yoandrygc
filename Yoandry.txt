professional setups. Known for delivering quality products on time. Possessing a wide variety of 
skills that allow to develop any type of software, be it, mobile, web, desktop or any other.

It will be good to battle test my javascript skills in a real project. I master several languages, that one included, so, what remains is to challenge that claim.
